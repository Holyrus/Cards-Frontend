Replace your .map rendering with react-window's FixedSizeList:

import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window'
// ...existing code...

{ currentDeck?.cards?.length !== 0 && currentDeck && isCardsOpen && 
  <div className={`w-[270px] sm:w-[500px] md:w-[700px] lg:[800px] flex flex-col
    ${theme === 'Black' ? 'bg-[#0d0d0d]' : 'bg-white'}`}>
    <List
      height={600} // or any height you want for the dropdown
      itemCount={filteredCards.length}
      itemSize={110} // height of each card row in px
      width={'100%'}
      itemData={filteredCards}
    >
      {({ index, style, data }) => {
        const card = data[index];
        // ...your card rendering code, but wrap the root div with style={style} ...
        return (
          <div style={style} key={card.id}>
            {/* ...card content here... */}
          </div>
        );
      }}
    </List>
  </div>
}

// Helper to filter cards as before
const filteredCards = currentDeck.cards
  .filter(card => {
    const textMatch =
      card.word.toLowerCase().includes(searchValue.toLowerCase()) ||
      card.translation.toLowerCase().includes(searchValue.toLowerCase()) ||
      card.usage.toLowerCase().includes(searchValue.toLowerCase());
    let stateMatch = true;
    switch (selectedValue) {
      case 'To learn':
        stateMatch = card.toLearn === true;
        break;
      case 'Known':
        stateMatch = card.known === true;
        break;
      case 'Learned':
        stateMatch = card.learned === true;
        break;
      case 'All':
        stateMatch = true;
        break;
      default:
        stateMatch = true;
    }
    return textMatch && stateMatch;
  })
  .sort((a, b) => {
    // ...your sorting logic...
    return 0;
  });



  Key points:

Only visible cards are rendered, so performance is great even with thousands of cards.
Adjust height and itemSize as needed for your UI.
Place your card rendering code inside the List's child function, using style={style} on the root element.
Result:
Now, when you open the cards dropdown, only a small subset of cards is rendered at any time, making the UI fast and responsive even with thousands of cards.
